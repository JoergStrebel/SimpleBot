# SimpleBot
A simple chatbot experiment in C and Prolog. It uses SWI-Prolog for natural language proccessing. SimpleBot only understands (very simple) German.  
It was specifically design NOT to use pattern matching and canned responses, but to leverage its syntactical and semantical models to produce answers. 

Build it with:  
```$ cd src ```  
```$ make ```  


Run it:  
`$ ./simplebot`
